title: Blog 0: Working with Jekyll and Docker
---

Last week was the first week of class, and my workload is already slammed! Getting into the right state of mind is always difficult when returning from summer vacation. With that being said, I am really excited to start on my first CIT projects for the semester. This year I am taking Senior Design Project which is gonna be my last CIT class before I graduate! 

For my senior design class we are starting off with a few projects. The first project is a blog that students will update on a weekly basis. The idea is that we can use this blog as a tool to help find a job when we start going to interviews after we graduate. And i think that is a great idea! To accomplish this task I decided to use Jekyll, which is a static site generator that works really well with github pages to create my blog. The advantage of Jekyll is that it can be used to generate websites very quickly and effeciently. It also works well with github-pages which is a great way to host your static websites for free!! But as great as Jekyll is, I have to admit it was very difficult to set-up. I ran into all the problems, including not being able to change the theme, which in theory, should be the easiest thing to do. But nonetheless, after repeated trial and error I was able to get everything working. It was a great learning experience. I used Ruby and RubyGem to install Jekyll, and I got to get a little more familiar with github. This was my first time performing a commit/push/pull in command line for github, it was so exciting!

The other project we had this week was to get familiar with Docker. Docker is a set of platform-as-a-service products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers. Containers are isolated from one another and bundle their own software, libraries and configuration files. I initially had some difficulties getting docker to work with Windows 10. So I installed the Windows subsystem for Linux. This allows me to run Linux in a window on my Windows 10 desktop without the use of Virtual Machines. Which is really cool! This is a relatively new feature to Windows 10, and I absolutley love it.

With that all being said, it has been a really interesting first couple weeks of class. I am defintely looking forward to future projects in my Senior Design class!
